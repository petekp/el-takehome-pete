Establish a routine so ironclad that the cat associates your presence with reliable comfort rather than chaos.\n\n**What will actually happen**\nThe cat will accept the food, interpret the routine as the bare minimum expected of a servant, and continue to knock things off tables while maintaining direct eye contact.\n\n**The healthy reframe**\nYou are not in charge. You are a beloved and well-compensated employee. The benefits are excellent (warmth, purring, the occasional dead moth as a bonus). Lean into it.',

Three nudges later, the Library of Alexandria is a water park.\n\n**Do not tell anyone.** Not because of timeline integrity — because everyone will immediately ask you to go back and buy Bitcoin, and you'll never hear the end of it.\n\nSafest first trip: go twenty minutes into the future, confirm the machine has a return function, come straight back.
